The notebooks in this folder are for digit recognition with neural network. The dataset used is MNIST. The MNIST dataset contains scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.
